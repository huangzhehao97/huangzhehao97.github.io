Hi, I am Narciso Yellow, a software engineer, graduated from Taizhou Institute of Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, with a GPA of 2.75 (a loser no doubt). I am currently working in Shanghai, engaged in network-related operation and maintenance work, and occasionally do some development work.
My favorite technology stacks are Java, Spring, Kubernetes, Golang. I hope to study software engineering in depth.
